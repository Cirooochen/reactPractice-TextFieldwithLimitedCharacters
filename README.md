# Task: Create a Live Character Counter App with Auto-Save

**📌 Goal**

Build a small app where the user types text into a textarea, and: 1. You count the number of characters typed (using useState) 2. You auto-save the content to localStorage (using useEffect) 3. When the page refreshes, the text is restored from localStorage

⸻

**✨ Bonus Features (Optional Stretch Goals)**
• Show “Saved” or “Not Saved” status on the UI
• Limit the text to 300 characters and show remaining characters
• Add a clear button
